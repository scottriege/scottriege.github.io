# Welcomer to my code!

For my website, I included several aspects that I learned in class.
Starting with the graphical design using the program GIMP
where I learned the basics of color correction and photo editing 
I also learned the basics of Dartfish for video analysis of both movements and team sports
and to finish off I showcased what I learned about using Microsoft Excel
